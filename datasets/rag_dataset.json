    "actual_output": "SQL injection is a code injection technique where attackers insert malicious SQL statements into input fields. To prevent it, use parameterized queries, input validation, and ORM frameworks.",

      "SQL injection is one of the most common web application vulnerabilities. It allows attackers to interfere with database queries.",
      "Prevention methods include: 1) Use prepared statements with parameterized queries, 2) Use stored procedures, 3) Validate user input, 4) Use ORM libraries.",

    "actual_output": "XSS is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by users. Prevent it by sanitizing user input, using Content Security Policy headers, and encoding output.",
    "expected_output": "Cross-site scripting enables attackers to inject client-side scripts. Mitigation includes input validation, output encoding, and CSP headers.",
    "retrieval_context": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker injects malicious scripts into content from trusted websites.",
      "There are three main types: Stored XSS, Reflected XSS, and DOM-based XSS.",

    "actual_output": "Rate limiting restricts the number of API requests a client can make within a time window. This prevents abuse, protects against DDoS attacks, and ensures fair resource usage across all users.",
    "expected_output": "Rate limiting controls request frequency to prevent abuse and ensure system stability. It's essential for API security and availability.",
    "retrieval_context": [
      "Rate limiting is a strategy to limit network traffic and prevent API abuse by restricting request frequency.",
      "Common strategies: Fixed window, Sliding window, Token bucket algorithm.",

    "input": "What is the principle of least privilege?",
    "actual_output": "The principle of least privilege means granting users and systems only the minimum permissions needed to perform their tasks. This limits potential damage from security breaches or mistakes.",
    "expected_output": "Least privilege ensures entities have only necessary access rights, minimizing security risks and blast radius of breaches.",
    "retrieval_context": [
      "The principle of least privilege (PoLP) is a computer security concept requiring minimal access rights for users, accounts, and processes.",
      "Implementation: Role-based access control (RBAC), just-in-time access, regular permission audits.",
      "Benefits: Reduced attack surface, limited breach impact, better compliance with security standards."
